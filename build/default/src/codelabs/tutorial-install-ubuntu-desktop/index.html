    <ul>
<li>We recommend you plug your computer into a power source</li>
<li>You should also make sure you have enough space on your computer to install Ubuntu</li>
<li>You will need a DVD or USB flash drive with Ubuntu on it, there are <a href="/" target="_blank">several tutorials</a> that help explain how.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Tip - if you are installing Ubuntu alongside macOS, you might want to <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html" target="_blank">install refind</a> to make choosing your OS at startup easier. You can install it from either macOS or Ubuntu.</p>

  <google-codelab-step label="Using a DVD?" duration="1">
    <p>It's easy to install Ubuntu from a DVD. Here's what you need to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put the Ubuntu DVD into the DVD-drive</li>
<li>Restart your computer. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the DVD.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't get this menu, read the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD?_ga=2.102380610.2115462233.1496186978-1155966827.1485186360" target="_blank">booting from the DVD guide</a> for more information.</p>

  <google-codelab-step label="Using a USB drive?" duration="1">
    <p>Most newer computers can boot from USB. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the USB.</p>
<p>If your computer doesn't automatically do so, you might need to press the <code>F12</code> key to bring up the boot menu, but be careful not to hold it down - that can cause an error message.</p>
