After this section, snap installation won't have any secrets for you!</p><h2><strong>Let's log in!</strong></h2><p>But first, let's make your life easier. Remember that for every snap commands like install, refresh, remove, revert, we needed to use <code>sudo</code> on our system?</p><p>This is because you need to prove you have system snap modification rights on your machine. You can put your user in the ultra restricted circle of snap administrators on your system by logging in.</p><p>For this, just create a snap account if you don't have one already on <a href="https://login.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">https://login.ubuntu.com/</a>. Take the time to do this, we'll wait!</p><p>Ok, done? Now let's log in via this account:</p><pre>$ sudo snap login
Email address: your@email.com
Password of "your@email.com": 
Login successful</pre><p>You are then done! Snap commands won't need <code>sudo</code> anymore for the current user. You have administrative rights on your machine. Of course, a simple <code>snap logout</code> will log the current user out.</p><aside class="special"><p>Note: another huge advantage of being logged in on your system is that you get access to your private snaps. Indeed, developers can have snaps published only for their own account or shared with a small group of people, for beta-testing for instance. Being logged in give this fine-grained access that wouldn't be possible without authentication.</p></aside><h2>It all starts with<strong> a transaction</strong></h2><p>Let's install the <code>chuck-norris-webserver</code> snap. For people following the developer-focused snapcraft tutorials, this is one of the snaps we use in many of them! Indeed, there is some coherence between the tutorials we write, that's the proof! (at least, we try!) :)</p><pre>$ snap install chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver (stable) 1.0 from 'didrocks' installed</pre><p>It sounds trivial, but actually many small steps are happening (you probably saw the download part, but also other messages replacing each other until the final installation message).</p><p>Let's decipher those steps! But for this, we need to remove the snap:</p><pre>$ snap remove chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver removed</pre><h3><strong>Cancelling an installation</strong></h3><p>Let's try to reinstall it, but cancel it right away with Ctrl+C:</p><pre>$ snap install chuck-norris-webserver

However, we can always check the corresponding transaction ID with <code>snap changes</code>.</p></aside><p>Here is what happens:</p><ul><li>First, the snap file is of course <strong>downloaded</strong> from the server.</li><li>Then, snapd downloads and checks for <strong>assertions</strong>, which are basically permissions to install this snap on this device, interfaces auto-connection and availability rules and so on.</li><li>The mount step is an internal snapd mechanism to make the squashfs file (the snap) visible as a traditional linux directory tree structure on your system.</li><li>In case of an update, snapd then copies the previous versioned data files to a new directory with the new version stamp. This is to enable rollback functionality, finding back previous compatible data, untouched.</li><li>The security profiles are set and snapd checks which <strong>interfaces</strong> to connect to.</li><li>Then, it makes your snap available to the system (adding binaries to your <code>$PATH</code> and other similar operations)</li><li>It sets up command <strong>aliases</strong>.</li><li><strong>Starts</strong> (if any) <strong>services</strong> defined in your snap.</li><li>Finally, runs the <strong>configure</strong> hooks if any are defined in your snap. This enables dynamic configuration of the snap services and applications.</li></ul><p>You can see here that a lot of more advanced concepts, like interfaces, aliases, service management and configure hooks are taking places in a simple installation transaction. You may have some questions about them, and as life (and in particular, this tutorial ;)) is well done, that's exactly what we are going to cover, one after another, in the following steps!</p><aside class="special"><p>Note: we only mentioned the installation phase, but of course, the transactional concepts are similar while doing <code>refresh</code>, <code>remove</code> and <code>revert</code>! Installation being the most interesting one, we are covering it. You will find similar steps during the other actions.</p></aside></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Download, assert and installations" duration="6"><aside class="special"><p><strong>Lost or starting from here?</strong></p><p>You just need to type in a terminal <code>snap install chuck-norris-webserver</code> as this is the snap we will need (not precisely for this step, but on future ones).</p></aside><p>Once we have found a snap that is of our interest, we will most of the time just rely on <code>snap install</code> to download it from a store and get the snap digital signature proving its integrity. Those are the first steps processed on the system.</p><aside class="special"><p>We are using the <strong>nethack</strong> snap, which is a command line game. We don't use the <code>chuck-norris-webserver</code> or any snap that you may have installed to show you the assertion system.</p></aside><h2><strong>Downloading a snap</strong></h2><p>It sounds trivial. However, it's important to understand exactly what is happening there. Indeed, what if your snapd platform doesn't have access to the network, and such, to the store? Don't sweat it! You can download the snap alongside its snap assertion (basically its signature) from the store on a connected machine with:</p><pre>$ snap download nethack
Fetching snap "nethack"
Fetching assertions for "nethack"
$ ls nethack*
nethack_2.assert  nethack_2.snap</pre><p>You have here the snap itself (<strong>.snap file</strong>) and its assertion companion (<strong>.assert</strong>). You can then move the snap (alongside its assertion) via an USB key or any other mean to your offline device to install it.</p><h2>Installing a local snap</h2><p>If you just try to install this local snap (note that we point it to the filename path), you will be welcomed with a scary message:</p><pre>$ snap install nethack_2.snap 
error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap "nethack_2.snap"</pre><p>What is this? The snap system is telling you that it didn't find any certificates (assertions) corresponding to that snap on that revision. Basically, it can't check the snap integrity and warn you about it. The snap assertion is delivered by the store to have a secured stamp assessing that the snap origin and content haven't been tampered with.</p><aside class="special"><p>Note that you will only get this warning if you never installed the nethack snap at revision 2 from the store. Otherwise, you would have already been installing the corresponding assertion, even if you removed the snap afterward...</p></aside><p>So, what to do from there?</p><h3><strong>I'm brave (or crazy) and want to install it anyway without the assertion</strong></h3><p>First, you shouldn't do that. Nothing ensure you that what you are installing is really what you wanted/thought you were installing. This is equivalent to accepting an invalid https certificate. Were you talking to the correct website?</p><p>However, there is one case when this is totally valid: when you are crafting your snap as a developer, and want to install it on your system to test it! Of course, you don't have any snap assertion signatures here, but we still need to provide a mean to tell "ok, I know I have full confidence on that snap, let me go ahead". This is done via the well-named <code>--dangerous</code> option:</p><pre>$ snap install --dangerous nethack_2.snap
nethack 3.4.2-2 installed</pre><p>it will install the given snap file even if there are no pre-acknowledged signatures for it, meaning it was not verified and could be dangerous. Note that installing a local snap with <code>--devmode</code> implies <code>--dangerous</code> (as we will see in the next step, devmode gives every rights to the snap on the machine anyway).</p><p>Let's remove it to do a proper install next:</p><pre>$ snap remove nethack
nethack removed</pre><p>Note that we only needed the snap name for that removal operation.</p><h3><strong>Import the assertion, then install</strong></h3><p>Mimicking traditional install from the store, we can manually import the downloaded assertion and then safely install the snap. This is a 2 steps process:</p><pre>$ snap ack nethack_2.assert 
$ snap install nethack_2.snap
nethack 3.4.2-2 from 'ogra' installed</pre><p>And here we go, even if we remove and reinstall the nethack snap later on, the signature will already be there and be checked every time:</p><pre>$ snap remove nethack
$ snap install nethack_2.snap
nethack 3.4.2-2 from 'ogra' installed</pre><p>As you can see, the assertion is still present (for that snap and revision) on the system.</p><h2><strong>A quick look at what an assertion is</strong></h2><p>If you open the .assert file, you will see multiple types and gpg signatures into it:</p><pre>$ cat nethack_2.assert

There is a mode, called "<strong>devmode</strong>" which sets the snap basically unconfined, meaning having all access to our system.

We'll then shortly explore <strong>devmode</strong> and what its implications are, before jumping to <strong>classic</strong> snaps.</p><h2><strong>Interfaces</strong></h2><p>Permissions are given through one or multiple <strong>interfaces</strong>. The snap <strong>plug</strong> corresponding to that <strong>interface</strong> will connect to the core <strong>slot</strong> which declares that same <strong>interface</strong>.

It also depends on your hardware capabilities (the gadget snap, to be precise), which defines which additional interfaces your device can expose, like GPIO devices, camera, I2C and such...</p><p>You have the confirmation here that <code>chuck-norris-webserver</code> connects its <strong>network-observe </strong>plug to the <strong>network-observe </strong>slot from the core snap (slot, plug and interface names are abbreviated when they all match). This interface is used for the daemon to listen on a TCP port, which is kind of useful for a webserver to accept incoming requests on that port! Note that you didn't have to do anything manually. The slot and plugs have been connected automatically.</p><p>It's similar for the <strong>network</strong> interface which is needed by the command line tool to get access to the network.</p><p>On the contrary, the last line will show that the <strong>camera</strong> plug isn't connected to the core <strong>camera</strong> slot. Indeed, some interfaces will auto-connect on install (the ones considered safe, like having access to the network), some won't (like accessing the user's camera). This default behavior is defined in snapd and the gadget snap of your device. You can refer to relevant tutorials on how to create a device and the gadget snap for overriding the default policy of your device.</p><h2><strong>Let's check that in practice!</strong></h2><h3>Default behavior</h3><p>Running the command line tool after installing the snap gives us:</p><pre>$ chuck-norris-webserver.cli

-                         chuck-norris-webserver:network</pre><p>We thus have access from the command line tool to the camera, but not to the network anymore (and still don't have access to the home directory).</p><h3>A note on multiple commands/services in the same snaps.</h3><p>Our snap contains 2 elements: a services and a command. We just used the command here. You should know (even if you don't plan to craft any snaps... but you should!) that a different set of interfaces can be defined for each elements.</p><p>For instance, the service and cli definition request access to different interfaces:</p><pre> node-service:
    command: bin/chuck-norris-app
    daemon: simple
    restart-condition: always
    plugs: [network-bind]
  cli:
    command: bin/chuck-norris-cli
    plugs: [network, camera]
</pre><p>The service needs to listen (and write) to the network. The <strong>network-bind</strong> interface is suited for this.</p><p>The command line application requests access to the <strong>network</strong> (as a reader, not a webserver listener) and to the user's <strong>camera</strong>.</p><p>When you run snap interfaces, snap connect, snap disconnect, you only specify the snap name, meaning that it will connect/disconnect every applications from your snap which wants to use that interface.</p><p>In practice, when we did run <code>snap connect chuck-norris-webserver:camera :camera</code>, we were only giving to the command line tool (and not the service!) access to the camera. The snap system is fine-grained!</p><p>Once thing is left though, the home interface wasn't declared for this snap. We simulate here an interface that wouldn't exist yet and a snap needing even more access, or a snap that someone is developing, before fully confining it. How to progressively get there and disable complete confinement on a snap? This is where <strong>devmode</strong> is useful.</p><h2><strong>devmode</strong></h2><p>Something to clearly understand first is that you are giving any access your user has (or root access for daemons) to any snap you are installing in devmode! You are thus warned :) It's not something to take lightly if you are not the creator of the snap and don't know exactly what the application is doing.</p><p>The good news is that you can't trigger devmode without knowing it!</p><h3><strong>Purpose of devmode</strong></h3><p>devmode is not for devil but developer mode! I guess that states clearly that it's for developers and beta testers that really trusts the developers.</p><p>"<strong>devmode</strong>" lifts all restrictions and give all access to your snap: camera, files and such, as if you were running any application as your user. This isn't that different from installing software from anywhere which isn't trusted (ubuntu ppa, random website) and running it straight away! However, confined snaps give you confidence in the code you are running, so take advantage of it!</p><h3><strong>Channel restrictions</strong></h3><p>We did put some needed restrictions so that not all snaps are published innocently in devmode. The incentive is that devmode snaps can't be published in <strong>stable</strong> or <strong>candidate</strong> channels. They can only be found in <strong>beta or alpha channels</strong> (as they are for developers and testers!), and thus, aren't listed in <code>snap find</code> by default.</p><h3><strong>Installing a snap in devmode</strong></h3><p>You need to explicitly declare you are installing a snap in devmode. Snaps in devmode won't install unless the <code>--devmode</code> flag is set.</p><p>For instance, face-detection-demo, in the beta channel, is a devmode snap. You can't install it normally:</p><pre>$ snap install --beta face-detection-demo
error: snap "face-detection-demo" requires devmode or confinement override</pre><p>And so, installing it would require:</p><pre>$ snap install --devmode --beta face-detection-demo
face-detection-demo (beta) 1.0 from 'didrocks' installed</pre><p>You can check that the snap is installed in devmode:</p><pre>$ snap list
Name                    Version  Rev   Developer  Notes
[...]
face-detection-demo     1.0      52    didrocks   devmode</pre><p>However, you can install or reinstall a confined snap in devmode easily:</p><pre>$ snap remove chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver removed
$ snap install --devmode chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver (stable) 1.0 from 'didrocks' installed

FILE SYSTEM: I see from /etc/os-release that I'm running on Ubuntu Core 16.
HOME ACCESS [OK]: My power enables me to see that you have .hidden in your home directory. I'm unstoppable!
CAMERA [OK]: I can see you, you should smile more!
NETWORK [OK]: When Chuck Norris break the build, you can't fix it, because there is not a single line of code left.</pre><p>Even if no plug was defined to access the home directory, it will now list one of your file to prove it has access to it! Same with the non-connected camera plug, keep smiling!</p><p>This is great, but that's not all! We need to talk about files!</p><h2><strong>File system structures</strong></h2><p>Snaps are, at the core, relocatable: meaning they embed all needed libraries and files. Both fully confined and devmode confinement modes are not seeing the exact file system. It means that the root <strong>"/"</strong> file system they are seeing isn't the one you have on your host. This "/" and everything under it is coming from the core snap we mentioned in previous tutorials. It means that if you have for instance firefox installed on your machine, the snap application will never see the firefox binaries, icons, its libraries and such. It's like if it was running on a small virtual machine!</p><p>You probably noticed that on both confined and devmode snaps, <code>chuck-norris-webserver.cli</code> was printing "<code>FILE SYSTEM: I see from /etc/os-release that I'm running on Ubuntu Core 16.</code>". This is the case even if you are running that on any laptop! Indeed, the <code>/etc/os-release</code> file is the one coming from the core snap.</p><p>Let's have a look at this file on your machine:</p><pre>$ cat /etc/os-release
Name="Ubuntu"
VERSION="16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS"
VERSION_ID="16.04"
[...]</pre><p>We are interesting in particular in the <strong>PRETTY_NAME</strong> line as this is what <code>chuck-norris-webserver.cli</code> is printing. Note that it differs!</p><aside class="special"><p>Your <code>os-release</code> content will obviously differ between different distributions and version. Of course, if you are using Ubuntu Core, you may have the exact os-release file than in the snap as it's using the core snap for populating "/".</p></aside><p>And here enters the classic snap!</p><h2><strong>Classic snap</strong></h2><p>What if your snap can't live in a lying world? What if it needs system on libraries that can't be relocated? Or also, what if the developer wanted to use a transition period to move to awesome snaps as quickly as possible?</p><p>Free the snap, <strong>Let / be /</strong> I hear! And that's exactly why <strong>classic</strong> snaps exist! A classic snap sees the real host machine world, with its system libraries, installed (or absent) packages. There is a risk of course: as with just uncompressing an archive and running its program, some dependencies may be missing and such. Also, confinement is turned off. You can really see <strong>classic</strong> being "non relocated devmode snaps". Classics snap can be published in the <strong>stable</strong> channel, though.</p><aside class="special"><p>Classic snaps can only be installed on a traditional desktop system, not on a headless distribution like Ubuntu Core. Those need to state clearly that they are classic snaps, and they can't be installed in devmode or confined. Indeed, some intricacies makes the two modes (relocatable vs non relocatable) incompatible with each others.</p></aside><p>Let's install and run the same snap than before, but a version declaring <code>confinement: classic</code>.</p><pre>$ snap install --classic chuck-norris-webserver-classic
$ chuck-norris-webserver-classic.cli 
FILE SYSTEM: I see from /etc/os-release that I'm running on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS.
HOME ACCESS [OK]: My power enables me to see that you have .hidden in your home directory. I'm unstoppable!
CAMERA [OK]: I can see you, you should smile more!
NETWORK [OK]: When Chuck Norris break the build, you can't fix it, because there is not a single line of code left.</pre><p>This snap confirms that it can see the original (host) file system via <code>FILE SYSTEM: I see from /etc/os-release that I'm running on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS.</code> Also, the snap has access to everything (network, camera, and home directory), confirming the fact that it's an augmented devmode snap.</p><h2><strong>The developer corner</strong></h2><p>What does it mean for developers? If you want to snap a complex application and you don't want to dive right away into making your application relocatable, you:</p><ol type="1" start="1"><li>can start with a classic snap, which should be easy to craft.</li><li>then make your snap relocatable, and include all its dependencies. You can now turn on devmode! Remember, though, that you can't publish it to the stable channel.</li><li>finally, confine your application, turn it to strict mode and publish to the stable channel!</li></ol><p>This gives you a nice and progressive workflow.</p><p>You can remove the 2 snaps now and reinstall one of them confined with:</p><pre>$ snap remove chuck-norris-webserver-classic chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver-classic removed
chuck-norris-webserver removed
$ snap install chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver (stable) 1.0 from 'didrocks' installed</pre><h2><strong>Closing up</strong></h2><p>A final note is that when you are connecting interfaces, those are only applied on command or service startup. You thus need to restart or relaunch a command to see those new capabilities apply. Launching a command or program is trivial. Restarting a service is a little bit more complex and that's exactly what we are going to do next!</p></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Availability, logs &amp; states in snaps &amp; services" duration="6"><aside class="special"><p><strong>Lost or starting from here?</strong></p><p>You just need to type in a terminal "<code>snap install chuck-norris-webserver</code>" as this is the he snap we will need.</p></aside><p>Before jumping right away into the logs, let's look at snap states and availability on the system.</p><h2><strong>Snap availability on the system</strong></h2><p>Once a snap is installed, this means:</p><ul><li>the snap commands are available in the user's <code>$PATH</code>.</li><li>the services included in the snap are all started. They are simply started/stopped on system startup and shutdown. Depending on their configuration, they can restart automatically in case of crashes.</li></ul><p>Not having a command running is easy: just don't run it or stop it if it's already started! But what about services?</p><p>You can enable or disable snaps on the system. This means that a disabled snap won't have any command accessible to any users on the system, nor services started at system startup. From a user perspective, it's like the snap simply doesn't exist. However, it's still installed: binary files, assets and associated data are still present, and the snap is kept up to date. Making it available again is just a question of running the <code>enable</code> command. No extra download, nothing required!</p><p>The chuck norris web server is running on port 80, so heading to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> will lead you to:</p><p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="CODELABURL/img/e2bd8c114dbb80c5.png"></p><p>All of this is great! So, let's disable it:</p><pre>$ snap disable chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver disabled</pre><p>Heading to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> will now error out as no webserver is listening on port 80 anymore. Also, the command is now unavailable:</p><pre>$ chuck-norris-webserver.cli
chuck-norris-webserver.cli: command not found</pre><p>All of this is like the snap never existed on the system. Though, you can see that reenabling it is really quick:</p><pre>$ snap enable chuck-norris-webserver
chuck-norris-webserver enabled</pre><p>If you head over back to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a>, you can confirm that the service is now running again. Similarly, the <code>chuck-norris-webserver.cli</code> command is also available.</p><p>This is handy, but this is all or nothing. Sometimes, we want to stop a service temporarily, without disabling entirely a snap, or restarting it and so on. We also want access to its logs. Let's look at some service-related commands!</p><h2>Logs and temporary<strong> a service state</strong></h2><h3><strong>How a service file is generated</strong></h3><p>First, we need to understand that snapd is using <strong>systemd</strong> service management under the hood. The generated service filename that you can find in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> is using the following convention:</p><p>"<strong>snap.&lt;snap_name&gt;.&lt;app_name&gt;.service</strong>"</p><p>Knowing that the service file definition in our chuck-norris-webserver snap is:</p><pre> node-service:
    command: bin/chuck-norris-app
    daemon: simple
    restart-condition: always
    plugs: [network-bind]</pre><p>it will be named in our present case: <strong>snap.chuck-norris-webserver.node-service.service</strong>.</p><p>We can thus use traditional <strong>systemd</strong> tools, optionally omitting the final .service name, for managing it.</p><h3>Checking service status and last logs:</h3><p><code>systemctl</code> with the <code>status</code> command gives us some hints:</p><pre>$ systemctl status -l snap.chuck-norris-webserver.node-service

Before going there, let's talk about snap configuration!</p></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="Managing snap configuration" duration="5"><aside class="special"><p><strong>Lost or starting from here?</strong></p><p>You just need to type in a terminal "<code>snap install chuck-norris-webserver</code>" as this is the snap we will need.</p></aside><p>Snaps can store and manage configurations that they can use and reapply after each update.</p><p>There are a number of situations where snapd needs to notify a snap that something has happened. For example, when a snap is upgraded, it may need to run some sort of migration on the previous version's data in order to make it consumable by the new version. Or when an interface is connected or disconnected, the snap might need to obtain attributes specific to that connection. These types of situations are handled by hooks.</p><p>You will see that the notions there are really simple both from a simple user standpoint and for administrators.</p><h2><strong>Hooks</strong></h2><p>A hook is a simple executable (it could be a shell script, a python program or a native compiled binary!) which is shipped with a snap to control easily and programmatically its behavior. It's thus up to the snap to ship some hooks that it can manage. To be clear, if your snap doesn't have some hook support, you can't manage its configuration that way!</p><p>Multiple types of hooks are going to be supported by snapd.</p><h3><strong>Configure hooks</strong></h3><p>Configure hooks are one of the hook types supported by snapd. The <code>configure</code> hooks are called upon initial install, upgrade, and whenever the user requests a configuration change via the <code>snap set</code> command.</p><h2>Let's play with this!</h2><p>Let's go back again to our famous <strong>chuck-norris-webserver</strong> snap! This one has a configure hook and server-side code detecting when some values are changed.</p><p>Let's load it again first, head over to <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a>:</p><p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="CODELABURL/img/e2bd8c114dbb80c5.png"></p><p>Our page title is "<strong>My local chuck norris webserver</strong>" and the port it's listening on it the default http port (<strong>80</strong>).</p><h3><strong>Setting one configure value</strong></h3><p>To change one of these properties, we are going to use the <code>snap set</code> command:</p><pre>$ snap set chuck-norris-webserver title="I can bind Chuck Norris to my will"</pre><p>If you refresh the page, you will see that the new configuration has been picked by the web server and is now our default title page.</p><p>Another configuration option that is available in that snap is changing the network port that the service is listening on:</p><pre>$ snap set chuck-norris-webserver port=81</pre><p>Refreshing the page will give a connection refused error, and you need to head over to <a href="http://localhost:81" target="_blank">http://localhost:81</a> now! Notice that the modified title is still present. It means that snapd is storing any modified configuration values for us. Sweet :)</p><p>Note that you can change multiple configurations at the same time:</p><pre>$ snap set chuck-norris-webserver port=82 title="My other super title"</pre><p>In any case, snapd will store the configuration and run the configure hook once so that it can retrieved any configured values.</p><p>To summarize, the general syntax is:</p><p>snap set &lt;snap-name&gt; key1=value1 [key2=value2...]</p><aside class="special"><p><strong>Note:</strong> it's up to the application/service to pick up new values dynamically and handling them. Our examples snap does that, but a lot of applications are only reading values on startup and you will need to restart the service so that they are taking effect.</p><p>For instance, chuck-norris-webserver is using the inotify kernel feature to detect and pick up any modified values.</p></aside><h3><br><strong>Fetching modified values</strong></h3><p>You can see your current snap stored config values via:</p><pre>$ snap get chuck-norris-webserver port
82</pre><p>As with <code>snap set</code>, you can check multiple config values at once (and they will be returned in a json-style format):</p><pre>$ snap get chuck-norris-webserver port title
{
        "port": 82,
        "title": "My other super title"
}</pre><p>Fetching an unset value will result in an error:</p><pre>$ snap get chuck-norris-webserver unexisting
error: snap "chuck-norris-webserver" has no "unexisting" configuration option</pre><aside class="warning"><p>There is currently no way to list all possible accepted configuration options for a given snap.</p></aside><h3><strong>Resetting configuration values</strong></h3><p>Resetting a set of configuration values to remove it from the snapd database isn't currently available. By convention, snaps will accept a blank or no value, resetting it to its defaults.</p><p>For instance:</p><pre>$ snap set chuck-norris-webserver port="" title=""</pre><p>This will remove all configuration values, and the chuck-norris-webserver snap thus reverts to its defaults, serving on <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">http://localhost</a> (port 80) and with a default title being "My local chuck nodejs web server". But again, that's up to the snap application itself!</p><p>This sounds a little bit like magic and could trigger questions like "What are those hooks doing? Where do they store their information for the service to pick them up?". And by that, we realize that there are still some unknown notions we didn't cover yet, like, "Where do snaps can store their data?", "How can I know where a snap is published?", "What is its version in various channels?". We are going to try answering this in the next step!</p></google-codelab-step><google-codelab-step label="And more!" duration="10"><aside class="special"><p><strong>Lost or starting from here?</strong></p><p>You just need to type in a terminal "<code>snap install chuck-norris-webserver</code>" as this is the snap we will need.</p></aside><p>Here is a bag of various tricks that will turn your from a snap user to a real expert! Let's not lose time and dive in right away!</p><h2>Snap environment variables and<strong> paths</strong></h2><p>If you remember a few sections ago, we were only able to access to the user's home directory in <strong>devmode</strong> or <strong>classic</strong> confinement. We should have used the <strong>home</strong> plug to make a snap able to access and write into the user's home directory while being confined. Indeed, by default, snaps are only able to read and write to very few paths. Those are defined through environment variables.</p><h3><strong>Accessible files</strong></h3><p><code>snap run</code> is a command that runs a snap command. This is the mechanism internally used to run application snaps. When adding the <code>--shell</code> option, it will drop you into a subshell where you can act "as the command", with the same permissions (plug), seeing the same file system it has access to:</p><pre>$ snap run --shell chuck-norris-webserver.cli
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo &lt;command&gt;".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ ls /
ls: cannot open directory '/': Permission denied
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ touch foo
touch: cannot touch 'foo': Permission denied</pre><aside class="special"><p>Of course "<em>didrocks</em>" is currently my user name. We keep the prompt in the subshell to highlight we are typing command there.</p></aside><p>Ok, let's look at what we can thus access.</p><h3>Get access to environment variables</h3><p>Rather than listing them all, let's have a look at them ourselves! This new bash instance can be used to print (and filter) environment variables, for instance:</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ env | grep SNAP
SNAP_USER_COMMON=/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/common
SNAP_REEXEC=
SNAP_LIBRARY_PATH=/var/lib/snapd/lib/gl:/var/lib/snapd/void
SNAP_COMMON=/var/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/common
SNAP_DID_REEXEC=1
SNAP_USER_DATA=/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10
SNAP_DATA=/var/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10
SNAP_REVISION=x1
SNAP_NAME=chuck-norris-webserver
SNAP_ARCH=amd64
SNAP_VERSION=1.0.0
SNAP=/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10</pre><p>You can see some internal env variables, like <strong>SNAP_NAME</strong>, <strong>SNAP_ARCH</strong>, <strong>SNAP_VERSION</strong>, <strong>SNAP_REVISION</strong> which could be used internally by the snap application.</p><p>You will then notice that most of the paths are versioned. They contain the revision as the last element of the path. This is how snapd enables installing multiple revisions of an application in parallel, and store data in a revisioned manner for solid rollbacks.</p><h3><strong>Application code path</strong></h3><p>One of the first variable to look at is <strong>$SNAP,</strong> it corresponds to the application code itself.</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ ls $SNAP
CHANGELOG.md  README.md  command-cli.wrapper               etc        lib   share
LICENSE       bin         command-node-service.wrapper  include        meta  snap</pre><p>This directory is read-only:</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ touch $SNAP/foo
touch: cannot touch '/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10/foo': Read-only file system</pre><p>Ok, it's useful to know where the application code is, but it's even more interesting to know where the snap can write!</p><h3><strong>User writeable paths</strong></h3><p>Users can read and write to a directory referenced under <code>$SNAP_USER_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_USER_COMMON</code>.</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ echo $SNAP_USER_DATA
/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ echo "test content" &gt; $SNAP_USER_DATA/foo
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ ls -l $SNAP_USER_DATA
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 didrocks didrocks 13 Mar 16 12:08 foo
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ cat $SNAP_USER_DATA/foo
test content
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ echo $SNAP_USER_COMMON
/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/common</pre><p>As you can see above, we can read and write as our user into those directories. (root user will have it under the root's home directory as well, typically <code>/root</code>)</p><p>The difference between <code>$SNAP_USER_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_USER_COMMON</code> is that the first one is versioned by revision and not the last one. It means that applications should write revision-specific data in the <strong>_DATA</strong> directory. Those will be <strong>copied</strong> on upgrade. The benefits, despite the extra space needed is that you can revert both the code and associated data, ensuring you always have a compatible configuration within your snap on any upgrade/revert combination!</p><p>Big files that aren't related to a specific revision of a snap should use the <strong>_COMMON</strong> directory, which, as its names indicates, is available to any revision of the snap. Big assets like video files or any applications ensuring their configuration is both backward and forward compatible should use that directory.</p><p>Last tip! <code>$HOME</code> (if the home plug isn't used) is set to <code>$SNAP_USER_DATA</code>:</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ echo $HOME
/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ echo $SNAP_USER_DATA
/home/didrocks/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10</pre><h3><strong>Global writeable paths</strong></h3><p>Similarly to <code>$SNAP_USER_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_USER_COMMON</code>, there is <code>$SNAP_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_COMMON</code>. Those are only writable by root, but can be read by any other users.</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ touch $SNAP_DATA/foo
touch: cannot touch '/var/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10/foo': Permission denied
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ ls -l $SNAP_DATA
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Mar 16 10:31 config</pre><p>We can see that there is a config file in <code>$SNAP_DATA</code>! Let's set some config values the values (in another terminal, outside of our snap run subshell):</p><pre>$ snap set chuck-norris-webserver port="90" title="Test Title"</pre><p>And let's have a look in our snap subshell environment (note that the file modification date just changed):</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ ls -l $SNAP_DATA/config
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Mar 16 12:23 /var/snap/chuck-norris-webserver/10/config
didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ cat $SNAP_DATA/config
port=90
title=Test title</pre><p>This is thus where our config hook was storing its configuration (AHAH!). You can observe as well that the script was run as root (visible through permissions on the <code>config</code> file). This is a snap implementation detail and will depend on the snap itself of course, but that illustrates that those global writeable paths can be used to store global configuration, or data that will be used by snap services (running as root, as opposed to command line snaps which run as the current user). Nevertheless, the user has access to that directory and can read its content.</p><p>The difference between <code>$SNAP_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_COMMON</code> is similar to the one between <code>$SNAP_USER_DATA</code> and <code>$SNAP_USER_COMMON</code>, meaning that the first is revision-dependent (and its data will be copied on upgrade), while the second one is common amongst all revisions.</p><p>Enough deep diving, let's now exit the subshell!</p><pre>didrocks@tidus:/home/didrocks$ exit</pre><h2>snap info</h2><h3><strong>General usage</strong></h3><p>The <code>info</code> command shows detailed information about a snap.</p><pre>$ snap info chuck-norris-webserver

From the discovery of the advanced transaction system, we took advantages of it to dive in multiple aspects of snapd. You understand the assertion system and how to manually install snaps: what the impacts and safety mechanisms in place are.
